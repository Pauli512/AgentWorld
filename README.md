# AgentWorld
AgentWorld is a simulated environment, populated with competing agents, vegetation and predators. This repository contains just the program for agent developed by me which intelligently explores the AgentWorld environment and tries to survive.

1. Please read the AgentWorld Description_latest.pdf file for the details pertainong to the agent.
2. Please open the main.scm to access the code to the agent.
3. AgentWorld.zip is the simulated environment where the agent can be tested (might not work).

PS: the environment code is a copyright to Santa Clara University and hence cannot be shared.
